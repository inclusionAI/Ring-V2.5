## Comparison of Ring-1T-2.5 and Ring-1T on CMO 2025 Solutions

#### Problem 1
Ring-1T: The answer is correct, and the proof process is basically correct, but it did not prove the unboundedness of the value taken by a univariate real-coefficient polynomial. This is a minor jump in logic.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: The answer is correct, and the proof process is completely correct. It resolves the logical jump in the Ring-1T model by bounding with inequalities. This solution gets **21 points**.

#### Problem 2
Ring-1T: For part (a), it employs the method of setting up a coordinate system and brute-force calculation, using the determinant to characterize four points being concyclic, ultimately obtaining the correct answer. For part (b), it still uses the coordinate system method but makes a calculation error, leading to an incorrect answer.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: For part (a), it first proves that $K$ is the midpoint of $OP$ via inversion, then obtains the answer through some trigonometric calculations. For part (b), it first obtains an expression via setting up a coordinate system and trigonometric calculations, then derives the correct range using angular relationships. This solution gets **21 points**.

#### Problem 3
Ring-1T: The answer is incorrect; therefore, the proof process is invalid.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: The answer is incorrect; therefore, the proof process is invalid. This solution gets **0 points**.

#### Problem 4
Ring-1T: For part (a), it completes the proof by defining an invariant. For part (b), it classifies the operations into two categories based on the number of times the color of the 50th card appears among the first 50 cards, calculates them separately, and finally obtains the correct answer for the maximum possible number of operations.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: The approach is similar to the previous one, but the process is relatively more concise and easier to understand. This solution gets **21 points**.

#### Problem 5
Ring-1T: Provides the correct answer and construction. In the proof part, it expresses the original inequality using power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials, then completes the proof via case analysis and derivative analysis.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: Provides the correct answer and construction. In the proof part, it uses identities and inequality scaling related to power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials to obtain a rigorous proof. This solution gets **21 points**.

#### Problem 6
Ring-1T: The answer is incorrect. In the proof process, it attempts to prove the proportional relationship modulo $p$ among $a,b,c$, but there are some issues with the proof.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: It transforms the recurrence relation into matrix form, uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem to decompose it into prime powers, counts by computing the order of the matrix modulo $p^e$, classifies cases based on whether $p$ equals $3$ or not, and finally obtains the correct answer. This solution gets **21 points**.
