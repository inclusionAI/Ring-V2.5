**1.  Notation and the inversion**

Let the circumcircle of $ABCD$ be the unit circle centred at $O$. Set $d = OP$. Because the quadrilateral is convex, $P$ lies outside the circle, so $d > 1$.

Consider the inversion $\mathcal{I}$ with centre $P$ and radius $\rho = \sqrt{d^2-1}$. The power of $P$ with respect to the circumcircle is $PO^2-1 = d^2-1 = \rho^2$; hence the inversion circle is orthogonal to the circumcircle, and therefore the circumcircle is invariant under $\mathcal{I}$.

From the power of $P$ we have  
$$
PA\cdot PB = PC\cdot PD = \rho^2.
$$  
Thus $\mathcal{I}(A)=B$ and $\mathcal{I}(D)=C$.

**2.  Behaviour of the circle through $P, A, K, D$**

Let $\Gamma$ be the circle passing through $P, A, K, D$. Since $\Gamma$ contains the inversion centre $P$, its image under $\mathcal{I}$ is a line. That line must pass through the images of $A$ and $D$, i.e. through $B$ and $C$. Therefore  
$$
\mathcal{I}(\Gamma) = BC.
$$  
Now $K$ belongs to $\Gamma$ and also to $BC$ (by hypothesis). Its image $K' = \mathcal{I}(K)$ lies on $BC$ (because it lies on $\mathcal{I}(\Gamma)$) and also on the ray $PK$ (by definition of inversion). The ray $PK$ meets the line $BC$ at exactly one point – namely $K$ itself – because $P$ is not on $BC$. Consequently $K' = K$, i.e. $K$ is fixed by the inversion. For a point to be fixed under an inversion (other than the centre) we must have $PK = \rho$. Hence  
$$
PK = \rho = \sqrt{d^2-1}. \tag{1}
$$

**3.  Using the product condition**

Since $K$ lies on the chord $BC$ of the unit circle, the power of $K$ with respect to that circle is $KB\cdot KC = 1 - OK^2$ (note that $K$ is inside the circle). The problem states  
$$
KB\cdot KC = \frac12 OP^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}. \tag{2}
$$  
Equating (2) with the power expression gives  
$$
OK^2 = 1 - \frac{d^2}{2}. \tag{3}
$$

**4.  Coordinate set‑up**

Place $O$ at the origin and let $P = (d, 0)$ (this is possible by rotating the whole configuration). Write the line $BC$ in normal form:  
$$
\cos\theta \cdot x + \sin\theta \cdot y = h,
$$  
where $0 < h < 1$ is the distance from $O$ to the line. The midpoint of the chord $BC$ is  
$$
M = (h\cos\theta,\; h\sin\theta),
$$  
and the half‑length of the chord is $a = \sqrt{1-h^2}$ (since the endpoints lie on the unit circle). Let $\mathbf{e} = (-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)$ be a unit direction vector along $BC$. Then any point on $BC$ can be written as  
$$
M + k\,\mathbf{e} = \bigl( h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta,\; h\sin\theta + k\cos\theta \bigr), \qquad -a \le k \le a.
$$  
For the particular point $K$ we denote its coordinate by $k$ (the same letter, but the meaning will be clear from the context).

**5.  Equations from (1) and (3)**

First compute $PK^2$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
PK^2 &= (h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta - d)^2 + (h\sin\theta + k\cos\theta)^2 \\
&= h^2 + k^2 + d^2 - 2d\,(h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta).
\end{aligned}
$$  
Using (1), $PK^2 = d^2-1$, we obtain  
$$
h^2 + k^2 - 2d\,(h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta) = -1. \tag{4}
$$  
Next, from (3) we have  
$$
OK^2 = (h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta)^2 + (h\sin\theta + k\cos\theta)^2 = h^2 + k^2,
$$  
so (3) becomes  
$$
h^2 + k^2 = 1 - \frac{d^2}{2}. \tag{5}
$$  
(Notice that the right‑hand side must be non‑negative, yielding $d^2 \le 2$.)

Substitute (5) into (4):  
$$
\Bigl(1 - \frac{d^2}{2}\Bigr) - 2d\,(h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta) = -1,
$$  
which simplifies to  
$$
h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta = \frac{4-d^2}{4d}. \tag{6}
$$

**6.  Applying the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality**

For any real numbers $h,k,\theta$, the expression $h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta$ satisfies  
$$
|h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta| \le \sqrt{h^2 + k^2}\,\sqrt{\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta} = \sqrt{h^2+k^2}.
$$  
Using (5) and (6) we obtain the necessary inequality  
$$
\left|\frac{4-d^2}{4d}\right| \le \sqrt{1 - \frac{d^2}{2}}. \tag{7}
$$  
Both sides are non‑negative; squaring gives  
$$
\frac{(4-d^2)^2}{16 d^2} \le 1 - \frac{d^2}{2}.
$$  
Multiply by $16d^2$:  
$$
(4-d^2)^2 \le 16 d^2 - 8 d^4.
$$  
Expanding and collecting terms:  
$$
16 - 8d^2 + d^4 \le 16 d^2 - 8 d^4 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
9 d^4 - 24 d^2 + 16 \le 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad (3d^2 - 4)^2 \le 0.
$$  
Hence $3d^2 - 4 = 0$, i.e.  
$$
d^2 = \frac{4}{3}, \qquad d = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \quad (\text{since } d>1).
$$  
Thus $OP = \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ is forced by the algebraic conditions.

**7.  Existence of a configuration with $OP = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$**

We now construct an explicit cyclic quadrilateral satisfying all the requirements and having $OP = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Set $O=(0,0)$, $P = \bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}, 0\bigr)$. Then $\rho = \sqrt{d^2-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Equations (5) and (6) become  
$$
h^2 + k^2 = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac13, \qquad
h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta = \frac{4-4/3}{8/\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
$$  
The equality case of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality forces $(\cos\theta, -\sin\theta)$ to be a positive multiple of $(h,k)$. Consequently, $K = (h\cos\theta - k\sin\theta,\; h\sin\theta + k\cos\theta) = \bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},\; 0\bigr)$. So $K$ is uniquely determined as $\bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},0\bigr)$.

Choose any chord $BC$ of the unit circle that passes through $K$ but is **not** symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis. For instance, take the line through $K$ that makes a small angle $\varepsilon \neq 0$ with the vertical. Let $B$ and $C$ be its intersections with the circle, ordered so that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ will be convex. Define $A = \mathcal{I}(B)$ and $D = \mathcal{I}(C)$ under the inversion about $P$ with radius $\rho$. Because the inversion swaps $A \leftrightarrow B$ and $D \leftrightarrow C$, the points $A$ and $D$ lie on the unit circle. Moreover:

- Since $K$ lies on $BC$ and $PK = \rho$, $K$ is fixed by the inversion. As $\mathcal{I}(\Gamma) = BC$ for the circle $\Gamma = (PAD)$, and $K \in BC \cap \Gamma$, the concyclicity $P, A, K, D$ holds.
- The power of $K$ is $KB\cdot KC = 1 - OK^2 = 1 - \frac13 = \frac23$, while $\frac12 OP^2 = \frac12 \cdot \frac43 = \frac23$, so the product condition is satisfied.
- The quadrilateral $ABCD$ is cyclic by construction. It remains to check the angle conditions $\angle ABC < \angle BCD < 90^\circ$.

When the chord $BC$ is exactly vertical ($x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$), symmetry yields $\angle ABC = \angle BCD$. By rotating the chord slightly (taking a small $\varepsilon > 0$), the angles change continuously. A straightforward calculation (or a continuity argument) shows that for sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$ we obtain $\angle ABC < \angle BCD$. Moreover, both angles stay acute because the points remain on the unit circle and the configuration stays convex. Hence all hypotheses are met.

Therefore a configuration with $OP = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ exists.

**Conclusion**

The only possible value of $OP$ is  
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}}}.
