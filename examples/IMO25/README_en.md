## Comparison of Ring-1T-2.5 and Ring-1T on IMO 2025 Solutions

#### Problem 1
Ring-1T: Provided the correct answer and construction; the overall idea of the proof is roughly correct, but there is a serious gap in the argument for bounding the number of points covered by non-sunny lines, and the explanation is unclear.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: Provided the correct answer and construction. First proved that when $n \ge 4$, there must be at least one boundary line; then reduced the problem to the case $n=3$; finally solved the $n=3$ case. The proof is rigorous. This solution gets **7 points**.

#### Problem 2
Ring-1T: Used coordinate method with brute-force computation, but there are several serious gaps in the intermediate steps, the calculations are not fully carried out.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: Also used a computational approach, but combined with vector methods, making the computation less cumbersome. The overall idea is clear, and there are no gaps. This solution gets **7 points**.

#### Problem 3
Ring-1T: Provided the correct answer and construction, but the proof contains several serious issues or gaps (e.g., directly assuming $f(3)=1$). Almost no part of the proof is creditable.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: Provided the correct answer and construction. In the proof, first divided into cases based on the value of $f(2)$. In the crucial discussion for $f(2)=2$, first proved that for an odd prime $p$, $f(p)=p$ or $f(p)=1$. Then proved that either $f(p)=1$ for all such $p$, or $f(p)=p$ for all such $p$, and discussed each case separately to complete the proof. There are no gaps or false steps. This solution gets **7 points**.

#### Problem 4
Ring-1T: Provided the correct answer and verified sufficiency. In proving necessity, there is a false step when showing that $a_1$ is a multiple of $3$; afterward, only considered fixed points and which values lead to fixed points, but did not explain why the sequence must eventually become a fixed point. The proof is not rigorous.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: Provided the correct answer and verified sufficiency. In proving necessity, first proved that the sequence eventually becomes a fixed point; then analyzed which numbers are fixed points; finally deduced which numbers can eventually yield a fixed point. The proof is rigorous. This solution gets **7 points**.

#### Problem 5
Ring-1T: Provided the correct answer, but in the proof, directly prescribed strategies for both players, completely violating the fundamental principles for proving such strategy-type problems. Therefore, the proof is entirely incorrect.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: Provided the correct answer, and performed case analysis on $\lambda < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $\lambda = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and $\lambda > \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. In each case, gave the winning player's strategy and proved that the opponent loses regardless of their moves. This solution gets **7 points**.

#### Problem 6
Ring-1T: The answer is incorrect. The proof mistakenly interchanges rows and columns, making the proof completely wrong.  
**Ring-1T-2.5**: The answer is also incorrect. The proof again mistakenly interchanges rows and columns, making the proof completely wrong. This solution gets **0 points**.
